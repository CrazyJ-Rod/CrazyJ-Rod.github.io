It's been a while since I have had a personal website, and after realizing I could host for free, and that I need a good place to store my notes, I decided to create this site. Jekyll is new to me for blogging, so we will see how that goes, but so far it was trivial to setup, and been easy to work with.
<br /><br />
I am mainly making the site for myself, but I do hope that some of the content can help the community. I have gotten so much help over the years, maybe I can contribute myself.
<br /><br />
To Do List:<br />
1) Write a short bio.<br />
2) Add in Disqus for blog posts.<br />
3) Upload the mass of material I have previously written.<br />
4) Begin studying "security" and preparation for the OSCP the summer of 2019.<br /><br />

Thanks!<br />
