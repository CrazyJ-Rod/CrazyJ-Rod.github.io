It's been a while since I have had a personal website, and after realizing I could host for free, and that I need a good place to store my notes, I decided to create this site. I also like I get to work with a new technology to me, Jekyll for blogging. We will see how it goes, but so far it was trivial to setup, and easy to work with.

I am mainly making the site for myself, but I do hope that some of the content can help the community. I have gotten some much help over the years, maybe I can contribute myself.

To Do List:
1) Write a short bio.
2) Add in Disqus for blog posts
3) Upload the mass of material I have previously written.
4) Begin studying "security" and preparation for the OSCP the summer of 2019.

Thanks!
Jerrod
