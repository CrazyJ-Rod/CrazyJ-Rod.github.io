<h1>Pentester Lab Review</h1>
    
<p style="font:25px;">
    <i>The following is my review of <a href=”https://pentesterlab.com/”>Pentester Lab</a>. I do not know the owner, did not receive 
     anything free to write this, or offered anything in return for the review.</i><br /><br />
    
  Pentester Lab (PTL) is a web penetration training platform that caters to students that wish to learn the art of web penetration 
  testing and web application security. According to the site, <i>PentesterLab provides vulnerable systems that can be used to test
  and understand vulnerabilities.</i> PTL provides online and offline exercises, real vulnerabilities; many with 
  <a href=”https://cve.mitre.org/”>CVEs</a>, all with detailed step by step directions in written and video form.
  <br />
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Bootcamp</h3>
  Louis, the creator of the site, also offers a detailed bootcamp that if followed, will take the novice to a skilled web application 
  tester. It is obvious Louis cares and is deeply passionate about web security, as everything he links to in the bootcamp is to one 
  of his free exercises or an external resource. While my background far surpasses the path he lists here, the simple fact he lays 
  out a plan for a newbie, while not attempting to sell anything, is one of the many reasons I chose to buy a subscription from the 
  site and push others towards it.

  <p style="font:25px;"> 
  Besides the bootcamp, there are tons of free exercises available. The exercises are identical to the PRO version, except there are 
      no videos or online version. To view all the exercises available, visit <a href=”https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/”> here</a>
      and have a look around. On the exercises page, click on “Free Only” and sort by difficulty from easy to hard. <br />
  <image src="/images/ptl/exercises.png" /><br />
  There are 24 free exercises to get you started. These exercises offer a great taste of how web application pen testing works, 
  how to think like an attacker, and allow you to quickly prove to yourself if the training is something you wish to explore more. 
  If you do wish to continue learning, you will be interested in the PRO version.

    <h3 style="font">Purchasing the PRO subscription</h3>
  <p style="font:25px;">
  By purchasing the PRO version, you get access to PTL badges that are composed of a course overview, one to two videos, both online 
  and offline exercises (in the form of Iso files), and links to outside sites for additional resources like hacker one, Wikipedia, and
  the like. 
  To start off, you begin with the UNIX badge, a set of 35 mini exercises that are only online. The next exercise set is the Essentials
  badge, a set of 65 mini exercises that show the basics of many of the coming attacks to be performed. These two seem critical to 
  complete before moving on to the other exercises. These exercises are shorter and more focuses, fills in the gaps of any areas you 
  might be lacking in and gives a number of successes that build confidence. <br />
  <br /><image src="/images/ptl/badges.png" /><br /> 
</p>
   <p style="font:25px;">                                            
   After completing the UNIX and Essential badges, you can jump around or follow the badges in order. Each badge is composed of 5-8 
  courses. The courses are well written and written in such a way that you can attempt the exercise on your own while taking peaks at 
  a sentence or paragraph to help move you forward without spoiling the attack.<br /> <br />
  Most courses contain well designed diagrams, and while the material is quite technical at times, Louis, the main owner, seems to 
  have a knack at breaking down the complex subject into easily digestible fragments.<br />
  As a side note, some of the attacks are just plain hard or you may not have experienced the technology before. Don’t be afraid to 
  watch the spoiler and read the content from time to time before working on the attack. You can always come back a few weeks 
  later and attempt the attack again once the material is a bit foggy.<br /> <br />
       
  Most courses contain one or two videos. The videos that give away critical information are tagged with “spoiler alerts” and can also
  be used like the written material, playing just enough to hopefully get the hint to keep solving on your own. In almost all cases, 
  the videos offer a step by step walk through. My only complaint about the site, is that the audio on the videos seems to be low, 
  requiring me to use max volume with my headsets.

  Another great feature is most of the exercises can be completed online. This is such a time saver, allowing you to focus on studying
  and solving the problem. When you do choose to use the ISO file, everything just works, unlike some of the older OSCP like Vuln Hub 
  machines I have used (which often take me longer to get working correctly than to root). Another small gripe, when you manually check
  the box that the exercise is complete, you do not get credit for course toward the badge. Some of the courses require a couple VMs or
  a box on the Internet to do online. This is one area I would like to see changed.<br /> <br />
  
  With PTL, you get hyper focused web attack training without using tons of tools beyond a proxy. Occasionally, tools like curl, ruby, 
  or John the ripper are used. Approaching hacking and security research like this, allows you to really learn web penetration and not 
  just tools that think for you. The best way I can think to describe it is like math, first you learn how to calculate and once you 
  have that down it’s safe to pull out the calculator. Many of the exercises I came back and used Metasploit on them for practice or 
  wrote scripts in Ruby (PTLs favored language).
  Most of the exercises are coded in Ruby on Rails, Java or PHP, but everything learned can be applied to other languages. The courses 
  teach the methodologies and train the brain on what to look for. If you are a software developer, like myself, they teach how these 
  web technologies can be abused and how one must think in order to write secure code. <br />
  Often new IT professionals will have the language X vs language Y debate (Think which is better python or ruby or perl, or managed 
  c++ vs c#). Since the training uses copious amounts of Ruby, this training would also go well with learning 
  <a href=”https://tryruby.org/”>Ruby<a/>.
