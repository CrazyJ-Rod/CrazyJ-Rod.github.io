	<h3>Certified Ethical Hacker</h3>
	<p style="font-size:20px;">I know the CEH is looked down upon, but the two instructors here do a pretty good job. The material is top notch and helped me setup 
	a methodology and I picked up some knowledge here and there:<br/>
	1) Here is the course to the entire 80 hours of <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/ethical-hacking-ceh-prep-2018">learning!!</a> <br />
	<br/></p>
